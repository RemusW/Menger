What has been accomplished: 
    1. basic understanding of the project and what needs to be done
    2. Starting triangle shows up on screen
    3. Working on getting the initial cube showing

Plan for completing on the project on time 
Work for a good portion over the spring break and then spend some of the time during the week of school it is due. 
We plan to further look at the openGL tutorials for the initial set and further consult the lectures for future issues. 
We finished the last project within a good time frame and think we will have no problem with time management and getting this project done in time.
